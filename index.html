                <h6>Overview</h6>
                <p>Nowadays, the world has become increasingly digital, with online shopping for everything from
                  clothing to groceries. Despite this, people are still cautious about using digital medical services as
                  health is a crucial aspect of our lives. In an effort to address this issue, I am creating an
                  application that offers various features such as virtual doctor consultations, lab test booking, and
                  an e-commerce platform for purchasing healthcare products.
                </p>
                <p><i><b>Challenges -</b> The design of this app presents a challenge
                    as the target audience is broad, ranging from ages 18 to 65. To ensure the best possible user
                    experience, it is crucial to consider the problems faced by users with existing apps and design an
                    app
                    that has a user-friendly interface.</i></p>
                <h6>What’s the Process?</h6>
                <p>For this case study, I have chosen to utilize the Design Thinking process. This approach was selected
                  as it is an effective methodology and mindset when tackling complicated issues, especially those that
                  are centered around human needs. By using Design Thinking, I aim to find the best solution to this
                  challenge in a user-centered manner.</p>
                <p><b>There are 5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process:</b><br><i><b>Empathize →Define → Ideate
                      →Prototype → Test</b></i></p>
                <h5>Let’s Get Started</h5>
                <p>I will explain each and every phase in detail and try to elaborate on research I have done to improve
                  the experience of <b>Medi Clinic</b>.</p>
                <h6><i>Phase 1: Empathize</i></h6>
                <p>I have done User research in this phase to understand what are the pain points that users are already
                  facing in other apps and to understand what they are expecting in the Medical App.
                  I have done research in two ways:<br><br>
                  <i><b>A. User Research</b></i><br>
                  <i><b>B. Market Research</b></i>
                </p>
                <h5>A. User Research:</h5>
                <p>There are two types of User Research methodologies, those are Qualitative and Quantitative Research.
                  I
                  have chosen Qualitative Research because I had a time constraint.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>These are the Questions I asked in the User interviews:</li>
                  <li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
                  <li>Do you have any family member who visits the doctor frequently?</li>
                  <li>How do you usually book the appointment?</li>
                  <li>How do you usually book the appointment?</li>
                  <li>Have you ever done consultations with doctors online?</li>
                  <li>When would you prefer for going online consultations?</li>
                  <li>Have you ever booked lab tests from home?</li>
                  <li>Have you ever booked Healthcare products online?</li>
                  <li>These are the basic questions I started the interview with, and every question has many follow-up
                    questions based on their answers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Overview</h6>
                <p>Bank Hub is a decentralized application that allows individuals to track their distributed
                  blockchain assets over a range of products and move them around based on real-time market data.
                  If you are not familiar with what decentralized applications.
                </p>
                <p><i><b>Challenges -</b> Bank Hub is a fairly new product and even though the overall product brings
                    value to users, we‘ve spotted some UX issues that are undermining the user experience for power
                    users.<br>
                    Our main goal was coming up with solutions to these UX issues while giving the product a new, more
                    minimalistic approach and making the interface easier to navigate through while delighting users
                    with a beautiful and pleasant experience.<br>
                    We focused on solving the following issues having in mind the flow of a power user:</i></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Improving the overall UI</b> since the current one has a lot of cognitive loads and reshaping
                    the
                    Compound protocol to make fit properly within the InstaDapp environment.</li>
                  <li><b>Remove friction from the trading feature</b> making it easier and faster for users to trade
                    their
                    assets. (We are going to call this feature trade instead of swap as our research shows it’s much
                    easier for new users to understand this).</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>The first approach for a new design</h6>
                <p>The result of our first design approach translates into a minimalistic dashboard that solves the
                  usability issues of the past design. We’ve solved these by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Changing the position cards from a grid layout</b> to a list approach that will allow the user
                    to have
                    bigger overall visibility without the need to scroll as much the interface allows to easily switch
                    between buying and selling.</li>
                  <li><b>A better spacing and hierarchy between the sidebar menu,</b> the protocol section and the
                    balance
                    section, allowing for better separation of InstaDApp functions and other protocol specific
                    functions.</li>
                  <li><b>Using a very soft colour palette</b> that makes the interface look organic and keeps the user
                    focused
                    on their task without much distraction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For this case study, I have chosen to utilize the Design Thinking process. This approach was selected
                  as it is an effective methodology and mindset when tackling complicated issues, especially those that
                  are centered around human needs. By using Design Thinking, I aim to find the best solution to this
                  challenge in a user-centered manner.</p>
                <p><b>There are 5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process:</b><br><i><b>Empathize →Define → Ideate
                      →Prototype → Test</b></i></p>
                <h5>Let’s Get Started</h5>
                <p>I will explain each and every phase in detail and try to elaborate on research I have done to improve
                  the experience of <b>Bank Hub</b>.</p>
                <h6><i>Phase 1: Empathize</i></h6>
                <p>I have done User research in this phase to understand what are the pain points that users are already
                  facing in other apps and to understand what they are expecting in the Medical App.
                  I have done research in two ways:<br><br>
                  <i><b>A. User Research</b></i><br>
                  <i><b>B. Market Research</b></i>
